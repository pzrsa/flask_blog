# flaskify - better than Twitter

Flaskify is essentially a Twitter clone built with (you guessed it) Flask.

You can register with your favourite email and password, and get started with posting!

Forget your password? No problem, just click the "forgot your password" button and follow the steps.

And yes, you can actually edit your posts unlike some platforms.

The site is deployed on Heroku, using the Free plan. Meaning the server goes to sleep when inactive. So you're going to experience a short delay (don't panic) when accessing it as the first user.

You can go on it at: https://flaskify.herokuapp.com/

I'm going to improve on it soon, since this was my first real project. But I'm open to all feedback at my Twitter (in Github bio).
